# Description of the program

The program creates two arrays.
To create an initial string array, the program asks the user to determine the size of the array, and then add all the elements from the keyboard.
The second array is created from the strings of the original array, removing all strings that are greater than or equal to 3 characters.

## Examples:
* [“Hello”, “2”, “world”, “:-)”] → [“2”, “:-)”]
* [“1234”, “1567”, “-2”, “computer science”] → [“-2”]
* [“Russia”, “Denmark”, “Kazan”] → []

## The algorithm of the program

1. Enter the size of the first array
2. Create the first array
3. Display the first array
4. Determine the size of the second array
4.1. Create a second array by modifying the first
5. Display the second array
