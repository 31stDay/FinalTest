# Description of the program

The program creates a new array of strings from the original array of strings, removing all strings that are equal to or greater than 3 characters.

To create the initial array, the program asks the user to determine the size of the array, and then add all the elements from the keyboard.

This algorithm uses arrays, not collections.


## Examples:
* [“Hello”, “2”, “world”, “:-)”] → [“2”, “:-)”]
* [“1234”, “1567”, “-2”, “computer science”] → [“-2”]
* [“Russia”, “Denmark”, “Kazan”] → []
